Homework for the ninth lesson  

**task1**  
Improving the shape assignment with the Sealed modifier for the Shape class. 

**task2**  
Improvement of the matrix multiplication problem.  
We have created a class Utils. In this class we created a static method to print a matrix to the screen using System.out.println.  
The method takes a two-dimensional array as input and returns nothing on output.  
Use this static method to print a matrix to the screen three times - print the first matrix, print the second matrix, print the result.  

**task3**  
Created a program to transfer funds from one client's bank card to another client's card.  
The data for the transfer is set from the console.  
The system stores information about the client's name, surname, passport number, date of birth.  
As well as his postal code, country, city, street and house number.  
Created a method of transferring an amount from one krata to another.  
Each card contains card number, CVC/CVV, current amount on the card, card code (id).  
Cards can be of three types: BelCard, MasterCard, VisaCard.  
There are limits on transfers. Limits are checked only for the card from which the transfer is made.  
There are different limits for each type of card.  
Cards can be in different currencies - therefore conversion is provided.  
A fee is charged for the transfer (set as a percentage).
